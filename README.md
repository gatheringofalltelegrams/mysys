# mysys
A collection of html/css files which can be used on a neocities, self hosted, or regular PERSONAL website. <br>
These CANNOT be sold, redistributed for profit, etc. <br>
These CAN be edited, shared, etc, as long as you link back to this repository. <br><br>

# How to use:
You can copy/paste the code into their proper pages, rename them as you wish. <br>
You can edit the html/css to add member profiles, blogs, subpages if you wish. It's all up to you!<br>
IF self hosted, the My Links can lead to websites you want to remember, for example <a href="https://minesweeperonline.com">minesweeper</a>. <br>
If public, the My Links probably shouldn't lead to your personal links to remember, unless you want to. Go wild. I suggest you use these for friend's sites, Patreon, other things you want to be public.<br>

# This is a major WIP as of now.
I will not be posting files until I am happy with how they are, but after they are posted I may go in and change them as I wish. <br>
While I am trying to add comments to make this as easy as possible to new coders, it is RECOMMENDED that you do know at least basic html/css. 

# I am very new to code. 
The code and file organisation here may be completely atrocious. <br>
Read at own risk to explode from awe at how bad it is.
